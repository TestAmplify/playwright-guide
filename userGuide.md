# Playwright Framework Interactive Guide - User Guide

## Purpose
This interactive web application helps you learn and implement the Playwright test automation framework. You can explore all framework components, view code examples, follow implementation steps, and learn best practices.

## Powered by Manus

This application is built with cutting-edge web technologies for optimal performance and user experience. The frontend leverages **React 19** with **TypeScript** for type-safe component development, styled with **Tailwind CSS 4** for responsive design and **shadcn/ui** for polished UI components. The application features client-side routing powered by **Wouter** for seamless navigation. Deployment runs on auto-scaling infrastructure with global CDN for fast worldwide access.

## Using Your Website

The application features four main sections accessible through the top navigation bar. The **Overview** page introduces the Playwright framework and displays an interactive flow diagram showing how all components connect. Click any component in the diagram to see detailed information, key features, and code examples appear below.

Navigate to the **Components** page to explore all 17 framework components in detail. Use the category filters at the top to view specific types like "core", "structure", or "utilities". Type keywords into the search box to find specific components quickly. Click "Show Code Example" on any component card to view production-ready code you can copy.

The **Implementation** page provides a step-by-step guide to building your framework from scratch. Each step shows commands to run in your terminal and tasks to complete. Follow the steps in order from project setup through final deployment.

Visit the **Best Practices** page to learn proven techniques for building maintainable test automation. Each practice shows a "Good Practice" example in green and an "Avoid This" example in red, making it clear what to do and what to avoid.

## Managing Your Website

Use the theme toggle button in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark modes based on your preference. The mobile menu icon appears on smaller screens, providing access to all navigation items. All pages are fully responsive and work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
